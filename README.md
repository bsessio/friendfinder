#BROOKLYN 99 FRIEND FINDER

##Overview

The Brooklyn 99 Friend Finder app helps you find which Brooklyn 99 member you are most likely to be good friends with, assuming raw numerical values can truly define the makeup of a friend, when the scaling is so bizarrely unprioritized.

##Instructions
Go to the webpage at https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/friendfinder-bws ! Click through the form, enjoy discovering this incredibly unscientific and non-binding friend search.

You'll need to fill out the form, and you won't be able to spam it.

##Package Dependencies

###Custom Dependencies
* friends.js - Stores the friends variable, literally that's it, which seems a really extra use of dependencies.
* htmlRoutes.js - Tells the browser what to do when y'all get some html links that need to do HTML things.
* apiRoutes.js - Tells the browser what to do when y'all get some links that need to do API things.

###Standard Dependencies
* express - needed on almost all files to handle express commands
* path - needed on the htmlRoutes page for sending pages!
